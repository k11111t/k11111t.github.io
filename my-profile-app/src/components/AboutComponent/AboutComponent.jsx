            <p>
            I'm Viet Hung Dang, a software engineer based in Manchester, UK. I hold a First Class Honours BSc in Computer Science from The University of Manchester (2019â€“2022), where I focused on software engineering, algorithms and programming in general.
            </p>
            <p>My passion for problem-solving began in high school, where I first started programming. Over the years, this interest grew into a career in software development. </p>
            <p>Currently, I work at Betfred as a Retail Developer, building and maintaining full-stack web applications with C#.NET, Blazor, React, and Azure Cloud. I also optimize applications for devices like Raspberry Pi and manage deployment workflows via Azure DevOps.
            </p>
            <p>
            Before Betfred, I worked at Dematic, enhancing warehouse management systems for clients like ASOS, focusing on performance and system reliability.
